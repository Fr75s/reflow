# Longshot Ideas

{requires more advanced XMLHttpRequest knowledge, but DEFINITELY possible as it has been done before}
x: Builtin Preload Scraper (using XMLHttpRequest? easy for missing descriptions and other text data but not images)
x: RetroAchievements

{requires manipulation of files/reading precise image data}
x: Preload blurhash calculations (maybe can be done remotely? but preferrably locally so as to not overload the blurhash website)
x: Preload image scraping
x: Full builtin scraper?
